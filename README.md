# Breakout-game JavaScript

The breakout game formed a big part of many childrens lives. 
This is a time when games were mean't to be enjoyed, Arcade style. 

JavaScript is used as the programming language.

The coding concepts used were as follows:
.querySelector()
Class
Constructor
This
.bottomLeft
.bottomRight
.topLeft
.topRight
classLIst.add()
.createElement()
.style.left
.style.bottom
appendChild()
e.key
switch()
setInterval()
clearInterval()
.removeEventListener()
.length()
.splice()
classList.remove()
Array.from()

Game components:
The game components that were considered within the functionality include:
-Blocks
-User
-Ball

How it works:
Hit as many blocks as possible using the ball, in order to score points. 

1. The user will simply make use of the left and right key on the keyboard to move the user block (which is located at the bottom). 
2. The user block will then be used as a launch pad for the ball. 
3. The user will then have to ensure that the ball hits the pad each time it moves towards the bottom of the grid. 
4. The collision betwen the user block and the ball, is used to aim the ball towards hitting the remaining blocks. 

Launch:
Simply use Visual Studio Code or any HTML/JS/CSS compatible IDE(Integrated development environment) of your choice. 

The code was originally constructed by Ania Kub√≥w of Free code camp. This is used as a basepoint for future adaptions that I aim to make of this game.
